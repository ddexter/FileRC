Installation Instructions:
Because Eclipse makes it nearly impossible to 1. have hierarchical projects and 2. import jars as libraries in plugin projects, there are a few additional steps.

Import each of the following as it's own plugin project to eclipse:
    FileRC
    JavaML
    ApacheCommons
    sqlite.jdbc
You can do this by importing an existing project, as the project files should exist for each.
